# Diabetes Hybrid ML model Method

## Step 1

- Find Decision Tree of the dataset.
- The leaf nodes on the DT are the partitions we are going to use

## Step 2

- Write Python code for partitioning dataset using conditions in decision tree

- train test split for each partition

## Step 3

- For every partition train atleast 5 models.
- calculate the accuracy and loss from each model.
- generate an accuracy matrix and find the best models for each partition.
